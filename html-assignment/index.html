            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/calvingdq.jpg" id="my-image"alt="Calvin showcasing a game at SGDQ2019">
            <p>My name is Calvin Rainey and I am currently enrolled at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario and I am taking the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program. I have always had an interest in the graphic arts and design from a young age so I am excited to work at honing some of my skills to learn to be a better designer through this program.    
            </p>
            <p>Some things that I enjoy doing outside of the program are that I have an interest in drawing, playing video games and enjoying time in nature through camping and other outdoor activities such as riding my bicycle and skateboarding. I am part of <abbr title="Awesome Games Done Quick">AGDQ</abbr> which is a charity video game marathon that raises money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and has just past their 10<sup>th</sup> year of fundraising in 2020.
            </p>
